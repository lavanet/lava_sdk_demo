## Playground

This repository serves as a playground for the Lava SDK, providing a simple React application that uses the SDK for decentralized and accountable access. The Lava SDK is imported and used in the `/sdk/form/form.jsx` file, allowing you to test its functionality in the demo React app.

If you want to experiment with the Lava SDK further, you can also use the lavaEtherProvider which is imported and used inside `./sdk/ethers/ethers.jsx`.

Feel free to play around with the code and see how the Lava SDK can be integrated into your own applications.
